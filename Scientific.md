In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group recognized the following eight subspecies as valid taxa: _African leopard_, _Indian leopard_, _Javan leopard_, _Arabian leopard_, _Persian leopard_, _Amur leopard_, _Indochinese leopard_, _Sri Lankan leopard_.

Results of an analysis of molecular variance and pairwise fixation index of 182 African leopard museum specimens published in 2017 showed that some African leopards exhibit higher genetic differences than certain Asian leopards which are recognized as subspecies.
