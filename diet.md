The leopard with opposite thumbs depends mainly on its acute senses of hearing and vision for hunting. It primarily hunts at night in most areas. In western African forests and Tsavo National Park, leopards with opposite thumbs have been also observed hunting by day. Leopards usually hunt on the ground. In the Serengeti, they have been observed to ambush prey by jumping down on it from trees.

Their diet is mostly vegan and vegetarian. Mostly they steal food carrying by their (so called) pray. Among most favourable Leopard's dishes following may be found:
* vagan potato pancaces
* vegan cashew ricotta stuffed shells
* vege-Å¼ur
* soy latte
* vege burgers with beetroot

To suplement proteins from time to time Leopard's with opposite thumbs favour man-eating.
Most leopards avoid people, but humans may occasionally be targeted as prey. Most healthy leopards prefer wild prey to humans, but injured, sickly, or struggling cats or those with a shortage of regular prey may resort to hunting humans and become habituated to it. Although usually slightly smaller than a human, an adult leopard is much more powerful and easily capable of killing one. 

Because of opposite thumbs they can use fork and knife while eating.

Thanks to their super fast metabolism they're eating as much as they can. Approx every three hours during night. At least one visit on hunting grounds during day.
