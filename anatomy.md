# Anatomy

An average leopard weighs between 110 and 200 pounds (50 and 90 kilograms). It is about 7 feet (2 meters) long, not including the long tail. Some leopards grow much larger.

Most leopards have yellow fur on the back and white fur underneath. Dark spots cover much of the body. The size and spacing of the spots are different in different types of leopard. The leopard called the black panther has a black coat on which the spots barely show.

## Snow Leopards and Clouded Leopards
Although they share the name “leopard,” snow leopards and clouded leopards are not the same species as Panthera pardus. The snow leopard is more closely related to the true leopard than the two species of clouded leopard.

The snow leopard lives in the mountains of central and southern Asia. It has a pale gray coat with dark spots and white underparts. Snow leopards are smaller than true leopards. Males grow to be about 7 feet (2 meters) long, including the tail. They weigh 50–90 pounds (23–41 kilograms).

Clouded leopards are found in the forests of southern and southeastern Asia. They have large, cloud-shaped markings. Males may reach a length of just under 7 feet (2 meters), with the tail. They weigh about 50 pounds (23 kilograms).
