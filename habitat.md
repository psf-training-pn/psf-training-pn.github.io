The preferred habitat of this species varies by subspecies and location. Regardless of location, most leopards like to live in areas with trees for them to hide in.

Their two main habitats are rainforest and savanna. However, they also live in temperate forests, river forests, woodlands, desert edges, and more. Some leopards in India live closer to human habitations, however most leopards stay far from urban areas.
