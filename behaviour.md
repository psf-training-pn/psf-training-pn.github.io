Leopards live alone. They come together only to mate. The female gives birth to two to four babies, called cubs. The cubs go off on their own after about two years.

Leopards are fierce predators that hunt mainly at night. Their prey includes antelope, deer, dogs, and baboons. Leopards also eat cattle and may attack humans. Sometimes they drag their prey high into a tree to protect it from other animals.
